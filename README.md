 							Welcome My Week1 project at Lux Academy and DSEA 5 weeks Bootcamp program


This Repository contains two folders named Week1 SQL and Week1 pandas.

The Week1 SQL contains two sql script files; data.sql, week1.sql and 5 excel files.

The data.sql file contains queries I wrote while loading sql_data.csv into the dbeaver.

week1.sql is the main file where I executed my queries for the questions.

The excel files; Weatherdata_Quiz1, Weatherdata_Quiz 2, Weatherdata_Quiz3,  Weatherdata_Quiz5,  Weatherdata_Quiz6 is where I saved the output of each question query execution. The sql_data is my dataset.

The Week1 pandas has two files; Assignment Week1 jupyter notebook file that shows how I did my assignment and the output of every cell.
WeatherData.csv is my original dataset.
