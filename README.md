# Welcome to My Week 1 Project at Lux Academy and DSEA 5-Week Bootcamp Program

## Overview

This repository contains the results and scripts for my Week 1 assignment at Lux Academy and the DSEA 5-Week Bootcamp program.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main folders:

### `Week1 SQL`

This folder contains:
- **SQL Scripts:**
  - `data.sql`: Contains queries written while loading `sql_data.csv` into DBeaver.
  - `week1.sql`: The main script file where queries for the Week 1 questions were executed.
  
- **Excel Files:**
  - `Weatherdata_Quiz1.xlsx`
  - `Weatherdata_Quiz2.xlsx`
  - `Weatherdata_Quiz3.xlsx`
  - `Weatherdata_Quiz5.xlsx`
  - `Weatherdata_Quiz6.xlsx`
  
  These files contain the output of each query execution.

- **Dataset:**
  - `sql_data.csv`: The dataset used for queries.

### `Week1 pandas`

This folder contains:
- **Jupyter Notebook:**
  - `Assignment_Week1.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook showing how the assignment was completed, including the output of each cell.
  
- **Dataset:**
  - `WeatherData.csv`: The original dataset .

## Getting Started
