# Welcome to My Week 1 Project at Lux Academy and DSEA 5-Week Bootcamp Program

## Overview

This repository contains the results, notebook and scripts for my Week 1 assignment at Lux Academy and the DSEA 5-Week Bootcamp program.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main folders:

### `Week1 SQL`

This folder contains:
- **SQL Scripts:**
  - `data.sql`: Contains queries I wrote while loading `sql_data.csv` into DBeaver.
  - `week1.sql`: The main script file where I executed queries for the questions.
  
- **Excel Files:**
  - `Weatherdata_Quiz1.xlsx`
  - `Weatherdata_Quiz2.xlsx`
  - `Weatherdata_Quiz3.xlsx`
  - `Weatherdata_Quiz5.xlsx`
  - `Weatherdata_Quiz6.xlsx`
  
  The above files contains the output of each query execution.

- **Dataset:**
  - `sql_data.csv`: The dataset I used to write queries.

### `Week1 pandas`

This folder contains:
- **Jupyter Notebook:**
  - `Assignment_Week1.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook shows how I answered questions, including the output of each cell.
  - It also contains code of how I updated the WeatherData to sql_data for easy loading to Dbeaver. 
  
- **Dataset:**
  - `WeatherData.csv`: This is the original dataset .

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can:

1. **Load SQL Data:**
   - Use `data.sql` to load `sql_data.csv` into DBeaver.

2. **Execute Queries:**
   - Open `week1.sql` in your SQL editor to execute the queries.

3. **View Results:**
   - To view results check the Excel files in the `Week1 SQL` folder for the results of each query.

4. **Review Pandas Analysis:**
   - Open `Assignment_Week1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to see the pandas codes and outputs.
